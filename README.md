INTRODUCTION ʕ⁠·⁠ᴥ⁠·⁠ʔ:

WELCOME TO OUR TEAM XYZ'S GITHUB PAGE FOR WRO 2024 
🌟 ｡⁠◕⁠‿⁠◕⁠｡ 🌟 

Hailing all the way from Bangladesh, we aim to fuse our creativity, coding skills and mechatronics knowledge to inspire many across the world to try their hands in the field of robotics ~ 🇧🇩

This repository serves as not only a journal for the development of our robot, named ABC, but also as a gateway to showcase the challenges we faced to overcome as a team. This way it ensures that our efforts can be replicated and even improved upon for any robotics enthusiasts stumbling across our repository ~ (⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)

Here onwards is the gateway to our coding progress journal: from the paper-bound sketches of our initial designs, to the final robot operating, we aspire to showcase our journey in complete details on this page. ~ (⁠◔⁠‿⁠◔⁠)
