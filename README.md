WELCOME TO OUR GITHUB PAGE FOR WRO 2024, WE'RE TEAM TEA BINGERS, SO GRAB A CUP OF TEA, SIT BACK AND READ ON ABOUT OUR DISCOVERIES 

🌟 ｡⁠◕⁠‿⁠◕⁠｡ 🌟 

Hailing all the way from Bangladesh, we aim to fuse our creativity, coding skills and mechatronics knowledge to inspire many across the world to try their hands in the field of robotics ~ 🇧🇩

FIRSTLY, A LITTLE ABOUT OUR TEAM:

Our Team consists of 2 members guided by 1 coach.

We are:

1.) Humaira Quyum 🐻‍❄️,
Design enthusiast and skin care fanatic. She worked on the external design, including which components to be used. (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠)

"Rest is as important as the work." 

2.) AKM Navid Iqbal 🐼,
Coding enthusiast, and a math wizz. He's able to take visions, and turn them into "mathematically" accurate realities. (^⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠^)

"If I'm able to take 1 step, I'll be able to take a thousand more."

Coach: 
Azima Nashra Quyum 🦊
Encouraging, Humble, Kind and uplifting, she has singlehandedly kept us motivated throughout the challenges we faced. (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠)

"Keep tinkering, because the solution you are looking for, may be a few adjustments away" 

This repository serves as not only a journal for the development of our robot, named Coco, but also as a gateway to showcase the challenges we faced to overcome as a team. This way it ensures that our efforts can be replicated and even improved upon for any robotics enthusiasts stumbling across our repository ~ (⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)

Here onwards is the gateway to our coding progress journal: from the paper-bound sketches of our initial designs, to the final robot operating, we aspire to showcase our journey in complete details on this page. ~ (⁠◔⁠‿⁠◔⁠)

INITIAL SKETCHES AND MODELS 
-
Coco was intially conceptualized to be rectangular in shape, with large wheels to allow for the best grip and a large surface area to allow components to be added without any difficulty as shown in first sketches created:
